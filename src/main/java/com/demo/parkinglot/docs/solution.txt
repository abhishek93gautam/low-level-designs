FareStrategy and FareCalculator

- BaseFareStrategy establishes the base fee using the ticket’s duration and vehicle size.
- PeakHoursFareStrategy modifies it based on the time of day.
- FareCalculator class is designed to determine the cost for each ticket by combining the effects of all applicable strategies (BaseFareStrategy, PeakHoursFareStrategy), ensuring the system applies the right fee based on how long the vehicle stays, its size, and when it is parked.
- This association between FareStrategy and FareCalculator maintains a structured pricing process, with FareStrategy defining the rules and FareCalculator pulling them together.
